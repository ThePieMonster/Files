# What Is Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a high-level, human-readable language that is used to describe the logic of an algorithm. 
It is not a programming language, but it can be translated into any programming language. 
It can also be used to communicate code and algorithms to other people.

Here is an example of pseudocode for a simple algorithm that adds two numbers:

```
# Input two numbers, a and b
# Output the sum of a and b

1. Set c to 0
2. Add a to c
3. Add b to c
4. Return c
```

This pseudocode can be translated into PowerShell as follows:

```powershell
# Input two numbers, a and b
# Output the sum of a and b

# Set c to 0
$c = 0

# Add a to c
$c += $a

# Add b to c
$c += $b

# Return c
Write-Host $c
```
